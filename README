This Program has been created using Qt and C++. It is a training for me to get used to using Qt Creator and GitHub

This software is able to read an XML file and countdown to the named event. Per default the program will look for event.xml in the same dir as the executable. This can be changed by using -s <FILEPATHANDNAME>.
Because mainly Qt is used I am focussing on gettng this to work on both Linux and Windows, only requiring a recompile to make it work on another OS. The default OS for this project will be Linux.
The XML file can contain multiple events, which can be chosen from in the software. 

Tasks:
-Accepting the XML file as an argument
-Getting the XML reader to work
-Creating a system in which you can pick the event you want from the list

Ideas for the future:
-Make the background the current time by using an analog clock. 

The example XML:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<events>
	<event name="2014">
		<description>the year 2014</description>
		<epochtime>1388530800</epochtime>
	</event>
</events> 
The name attribute, the description and the epochtime are required. The name will be used in selecting the event you want to count down to, the description is used as description in the gui itself and the epochtime is the time you want to count down to.
