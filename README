This Program has been created using Qt and C++. It is a training for me to get used to using Qt Creator and GitHub

The purpose of this program is to countdown to a certain event. The time for this event and the name of this event should be set in some sort of a config file, maybe a XML file. 
Because mainly Qt is used I am focussing on gettng this to work on both Linux and Windows, only requiring a recompile to make it work on another OS. The default OS for this project will be Linux.
The XML file can contain multiple events, which can be chosen from in the software. 

Tasks:
-Accepting the XML file as an argument
-Getting the XML reader to work
-Creating a system in which you can pick from the list

Ideas for the future:
-Make the background the current time by using an analog clock. 

The example XML:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<event name="2014">
	<description>the year 2014</description>
	<epochtime>1388530800</epochtime>
</event>
